This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in the terminal using Rust.

Functionality currently implemented:
- Initialize random world of given dimensions
- Allow user to provide world dimensions and delay between frames via commandline arguments
- Allow user to quit program at any time with the Escape key
- Allow user to pause/play program using the Space key
- Allow user to dynamically change the frame delay while the program is running using the left/right bracket keys

Functionality to be implemented:
- Get user input and update framerate on separate loop from simulation
- Initialize world from a file/save world to a file
- Use alternate game rules via commandline arguments
